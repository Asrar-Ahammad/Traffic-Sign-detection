# Traffic Sign Detection

The Traffic Sign Detection repository contains a machine learning project for detecting and recognizing traffic signs in images. The project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify and classify various traffic signs. Transfer learning is used to train **YOLOv5** for detecting traffic signs.

## Project Overview

The Traffic Sign Detection project aims to automate the process of identifying traffic signs in images, which can be useful for tasks such as autonomous driving, road safety analysis, and traffic management. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing techniques to achieve accurate and efficient detection results.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `model.ipynb`: This file contains the details about training phase of the model.
- `preprocessing.ipynb`: This file contians details about images preprocessing for the model training.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Traffic Sign Detection project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Asrar-Ahammad/Traffic-Sign-detection.git
   
2. Set up the required Python environment with the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```shell
     cd Traffic-Sign-detection
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
     env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  
3. Run the notebooks sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the results.
